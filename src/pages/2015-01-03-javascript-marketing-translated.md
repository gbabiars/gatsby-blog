There are a lot of marketing terms that get used in the JavaScript space to describe different projects. Here is what I read when I see these terms:

- Minimalist: Edge cases not included.
- Lightweight: It's smaller than something else out there.
- Simple: The api is perfect...for our use case.
- Modular: Have fun wiring everything together.
- Library: I swear we're not a framework. Please don't call us a framework.
- Framework: Good luck getting rid of us.
- Opinionated: You will do things our way...or else!
- Unopinionated: You figure out how to do it and then realize months later you did it completely wrong.
